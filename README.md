### Master vs Twin Branch
------
* The master branch represents the latest released version of NodeDJ.  This
branch will always have a stable and tested version of the library. This is the version currently operating. You can view the changes in the [Changelog](changelog.md) page.

* The twin branch is where all development happens and almost always has
new features over the master branch.  However breaking changes are frequently
added to twin and even sometimes bugs are introduced.  Bugs get fixed and 
the breaking changes get documented before pushing to master. Twin will often
be found in a separate room for testing. To help test, contact N8te.

### Bugs, Ideas, or Suggestions?
------
If you come across a bug or have an idea for the bot or room theme, you can submit them on the [Issues](https://github.com/N8teZero/RoboTHC/issues) page. If you don't have a github account, you can ping N8 on Discord.
