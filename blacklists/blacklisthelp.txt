Blacklists are .json files that belong in the blacklists folder.
They must be comprised of a single array of strings.
Each string just has to be: format:itemID
format can be either 1 or 2 for youtube or soundcloud respectively,
and the itemID must be the ID for the song, such as the video ID for a youtube video, or
the track ID of a soundcloud song.
Example:

[
	"1:dQw4w9WgXcQ",
	"2:103464380"
]

A soundcloud track's ID is not in the URL, rather it is in the Embed code for a song.
There are probably other ways to get it, but you'll want to look for a link such as api.soundcloud.com/tracks/#
where # is the ID you are looking for.

Once you make a blacklist file, you must then add it to the "blacklists" object
with a text editor inside coreOptions.js. An example entry should already exist there.
