# NodeDJ
Command-Line bot for Plug.Dj

### Collab
------
I'm looking for devs with experience in NodeJS or Javascript. Take a look at the [Sample](sample.js) code to get an idea of how the project is written. If you feel you could be a benefit to the team, Ping me on discord @N8 ネイト#2661 or eklipz08@gmail.com

### Master vs Twin Branch
------
* The master branch represents the latest released version of NodeDJ.  This
branch will always have a stable and tested version of the library. This is the version currently operating. You can view the changes in the [Changelog](changelog.md) page.

* The twin branch is where all development happens and almost always has
new features over the master branch.  However breaking changes are frequently
added to twin and even sometimes bugs are introduced.  Bugs get fixed and 
the breaking changes get documented before pushing to master. Twin will often
be found in a separate room for testing.

### Bugs, Ideas, or Suggestions?
------
If you come across a bug or have an idea for the bot or room theme, you can submit them on the [Issues](https://github.com/N8teZero/RoboTHC/issues) page.
